## Code Architecture

The `GuitarDiagramsJS` class is where site builders will start with leveraging the library. Every interaction happens with a `GuitarDiagramsJS` object, which then leverages the `GuitarDiagramsJSConfig` and the `GuitarDiagramsJSMarker` classes to for modularity and encapsulation. Site builders never need to know about the `GuitarDiagramsJSConfig` and `GuitarDiagramsJSMarker` classes.

## Scripts

The `.scripts/` directory contains Bash scripts for local development, build, and deployment tasks.

### `build.sh`

The build script prepares the project for release and deployment by performing these actions:

1. Call `package-check.js` to validate the `package.json` syntax.
1. Call `linting.sh` to check for HTML, CSS, JS, and Markdown syntax errors.
1. Copy `*.mjs` files from `src/` to `docs/examples/js/guitar-diagrams-js/` for use by `docs/examples/index.html`.
1. Calls `npm install ./` to add any NPM dependencies and update the `package-lock.json` file.

The build script can be executed by running `npm run build` in the root of the project.

### `linting.sh`

This script calls the `super-linter.sh` script (see below) and scans the output for any linting errors. This can be run as part of the `build.sh` script by running `npm run build` from the root of the project.

### `package-check.sh`

This script calls the `npx publint` to check the `package.json` file for correctness. This can be run as part of the `build.sh` script by running `npm run build` from the root of the project.

### `super-linter.sh`

This script starts a Docker container to run a local version of Super-Linter for linting HTML, CSS, JS, and Markdown. This can be run as part of the `build.sh` script by running `npm run build` from the root of the project.

## Building, Packaging, and Releasing

### Local Builds and Releases

- When all of your code changes are complete, AND...
- You've executed `.scripts/build.sh`, AND...
- You're not seeing any errors in the output of the build script, THEN...
- Commit your changes and push to GitHub, then issue a PR into the `develop` branch for testing.

## Releases

When you have enough features and bugs merged to justify a release, create a PR from the `develop` branch into `main` branch.
Once that is merged, use the [Release page](https://github.com/KCarlile/guitar-diagrams-js/releases) to create a new release which will kick off a new package deployment using the GitHub Action workflow defined in `.github/workflows/release-package.yml`.
Once the workflow has completed successfully, the package will be hosted on the [Packages page](https://github.com/KCarlile/guitar-diagrams-js/pkgs/npm/guitar-diagrams-js).

See also [`docs/examples/js/guitar-diagrams-js/README.md`](docs/examples/js/guitar-diagrams-js/README.md) for information about symlinks for local testing and demo deployment information.
